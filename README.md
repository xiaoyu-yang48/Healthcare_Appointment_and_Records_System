# **1. System Goal**  
Develop a healthcare appointment system based on the **MERN stack** (MongoDB + Express + React + Node.js), supporting patient registration, doctor scheduling, electronic medical record management, and basic doctor-patient communication.  

---

### **2. Core Functional Requirements**  

#### **(1) User Management**  
| Role | Functionality |  
|------|---------------|  
| **Patient** | Registration/Login, Appointment Booking, View Medical Records |  
| **Doctor** | Manage Schedule, View Appointments, Create Medical Records |  
| **Admin** | Manage Doctor/Patient Accounts, Adjust System Settings |  

#### **(2) Appointment Management**  
- **Patient Side**  
  - View Doctor Schedules (filtered by department, date)  
  - Select time for appointment (can cancel/edit)  
- **Doctor Side**  
  - Set available appointment times (working days/holidays)  
  - View their own appointment list  
- **Admin Side**  
  - Manage doctor information (CRUD)  
  - Adjust appointment rules (e.g., max 2 appointments per day per patient)  

#### **(3) Electronic Medical Records (EMR)**  
- Doctors can:  
  - Create, view, modify patient medical records (symptoms, diagnosis, prescription)  
  - Upload examination reports (PDF/images)  
- Patients can:  
  - View their own medical records (read-only)  
  - Download medical reports  

#### **(4) Doctor-Patient Communication**  
- Patients and doctors can send **in-app messages** (e.g., inquiries, follow-up reminders)  
- Doctors can send **follow-up reminders** (automated messages)  

---

### **3. Technical Implementation Plan**  

#### **(1) Backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)**  
- **API Design (RESTful)**  
  - `POST /api/auth/login` (User login)  
  - `GET /api/doctors` (Get list of doctors)  
  - `POST /api/appointments` (Create appointment)  
  - `GET /api/medical-records/:patientId` (Get medical record)  

- **Database (MongoDB)**  
```javascript
// User model
const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  email: String,
  password: String,
  role: String, // "patient", "doctor", "admin"
});

// Appointment model
const AppointmentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  patientId: mongoose.ObjectId,
  doctorId: mongoose.ObjectId,
  date: Date,
  status: String, // "pending", "completed", "cancelled"
});

// Medical record model
const MedicalRecordSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  patientId: mongoose.ObjectId,
  doctorId: mongoose.ObjectId,
  diagnosis: String,
  prescription: String,
  attachments: [String], // store file paths
});
```  

#### **(2) Frontend (React.js)**  
- **Main Pages**  
  - **Login/Register Page** (different entrance for patient, doctor, admin)  
  - **Patient Homepage** (appointment booking, view medical records, messages)  
  - **Doctor Homepage** (manage schedule, view appointments, fill medical records)  
  - **Admin Dashboard** (manage users, adjust system settings)  

- **Additional Tech Stack**  
  - **UI Library**: Material-UI or Ant Design  
  - **State Management**: Redux or Context API  
  - **Routing**: React Router  

---

### **4. Non-Functional Requirements**  
- **Security**: JWT authentication, password encryption (bcrypt)  
- **Performance**: API response time â‰¤ 500ms  
- **Data Storage**: MongoDB Atlas (cloud) or local MongoDB
